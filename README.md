# albelli-code-challenge
Albelli's Senior Frontend Developer Code Challenge

## Definitions
Since the app requirement is to be able to convert from Inches to Pixels and vice versa, I am using the standard print industry quality of 300PPI(Pixels Per Inch) for this conversion.

So given that the canvas size should be 15" x 10", it would be 4500px * 3000px in our app which we'll style to be 375px * 250px to be nice in a mobile/desktop screen.

Also everywhere in our app when we need to convert from pixels to inches or vice versa we'll use 300PPI as our conversion unit. Like when we want to generate JSON file in inches and when we want to import a JSON file in inches and convert it to pixels.

## Installation

Since I wanted to use **React** with **Typescript** to showcase my skills and also wanted to maintain the app structure Albelli suggests in the app requirement, I initialized a webpack project with Albelli structure and build up on that.

### Steps
1. Make sure you have Yarn installed: https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install
2. Clone/download the repository
3. ```cd``` to project directory
4. ```yarn install```
5. ```yarn start``` to run devServer
6. You can run all tests with ```yarn test --all```
7. You can build the app for production with ```yarn build```


## Tech Stack

- **React** as the frontend library with **Typescript**
- React's **Context API** to manage App State
- **React Testing Library** and **Jest** for testing
- **ESLint** and **Prettier** for code formatting and Linting
- **Webpack** as the module bundler and **babel** as the typescript compiler
- **Sass** for styling
- **Yarn** for the package manager
